initialize funcdetails with params, along with isarray
using arglist populate funcdetails
evaluate compound statement


doubts:
1. are global variables allowed nope
2. do we have to handle shadowing of declaration,  i.e, a variable of same name occuring in a nested block nope
3. do we have array parameters in function call nope

in function call
create a new node of funcdetails.
fill in its symbol table with argument values;
push current_function onto stack
push 0 onto return stack
set current_function to the node just created;
call function
pop return value and give it to the expr->val
pop fstack and set curr_node
